# ML/DL with PyTorch, TensorFlow and Rapids on a Dask cluster

Packages, tools, templates and documentation for distributed maschine- and deep learning.


This project aims to create a package and documentation to make distributed training on a Dask cluster easy.


Dask will run on every node and execute code which is needed for distributed training. Dask ist open source and easy to use.
It provides a wide range of functionality. Dask will run and monitor the Cluster here. 

-----
I will sort out some files and focus on PyTorch DL later. 
The Project and the information about it are still in work.

Project status: paused
